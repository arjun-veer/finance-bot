        "response": "Here are 2 financial tips based on the data provided:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Debt Repayment:** You have $1000 in debt. While your income is high and savings are good, allocate funds to pay off this debt quickly, especially if it carries a high interest rate. Eliminating debt frees up future income and reduces interest costs.\n2.  **Track Spending & Create a Full Budget:** Your current summary only shows $1100 in spending ($100 Food + $1000 Education Fees) against a $10000 income. Track *all* your spending categories to understand where the remaining income is going. This will help ensure you are meeting your $2000 savings goal consistently and identify any areas where spending could be optimized further."
